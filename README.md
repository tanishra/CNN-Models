# CNN Models

Welcome to the **CNN Models** repository! This repo contains implementations of popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, designed for learning and experimentation purposes.

---

## üöÄ Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models particularly effective for image-related tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation. This repository provides clean, well-documented implementations of famous CNN architectures built using TensorFlow/Keras.

## üìö Included Models

| Model Name  | Description                                         | Dataset(s) Used        | Notes                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| AlexNet     | One of the first deep CNNs, popularized deep learning for images. | CIFAR-10, ImageNet    | Adapted for CIFAR-10 with smaller FC layers. |
<!-- | VGG16       | Deep CNN with very small (3x3) convolution filters. | CIFAR-10, ImageNet    | Standard architecture for many tasks.  | -->
<!-- | ResNet50    | Introduced residual connections to combat vanishing gradients. | CIFAR-10, ImageNet    | Powerful architecture for deep networks. | -->
<!-- | MobileNetV2 | Efficient and lightweight CNN architecture for mobile and embedded devices. | CIFAR-10, ImageNet    | Great for resource-constrained environments. | -->

*(More models coming soon!)*
